ðŸŽ› Functionality Overview
ðŸ–± Buttons
Standard Buttons: Digits, basic operators, parentheses, history, clear, backspace, etc.

Scientific Buttons: Trigonometric (sin, cos, etc.), logarithmic (log, ln), power & roots, abs, mod, factorial, and more.

Special Controls:

RAD/DEG: Toggle angle mode for trigonometric calculations

hist: Show full calculation history

âŒ¨ Keyboard Shortcuts
Key	Action
Enter	Evaluate (=)
Backspace	Delete last char
Delete / Escape	Clear display
0-9, +, -, *, /, .	Insert into display

ðŸ§  Internals
Expression Parsing: Supports constants like Ï€, e and dynamic conversion of angles using radians() when in DEG mode.

Safe eval(): Preprocessed input string ensures Python-safe evaluation.

Hover Effects: Buttons change style on hover for better UX.

History Management: Keeps a log of previous expressions and results (recent two shown inline, full history in separate window).
